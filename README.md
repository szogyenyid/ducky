# Ducky

Ducky is a VSCode extension that adds a cute pet duck to the status bar of your editor.

## Features

Ducky is a little duck living on the secondary side of your status bar. If you click her, she will take a walk on the primary side of your status bar, then return to her home.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

**TODO: Some GIFs about it (home & walking)**

## Extension Settings

You can configure two attributes of Ducky:

* `ducky.distance`: The number of steps Ducky will take (measured in characters) (default: 25).
* `ducky.pace`: The time in milliseconds to take a single step (default: 150).

**Enjoy!**
